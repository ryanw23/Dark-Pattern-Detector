# Dark-Pattern-Detector

Welcome to the Dark Pattern Detector extension! 

This app and page were created by Ryan Wood as part of my Master's thesis for Computer science and Software Engineering. This extension does not collect any of your data or personally identifiable information. It is purely used to detect dark patterns/deceptive designs on webpages and any effects of the extension are removed by uninstalling it. 

If any issues or vulnerabilities are found, please contact me through my email, rmwood323@gmail.com
Thanks,
Ryan
